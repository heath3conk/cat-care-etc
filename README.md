Cats
====

Food
----
- Dry food: In a dispenser with a timer. I just filled the hopper so you shouldn't have to even think about this one.
- Wet food: Each morning, throw away any food left in the dish from the day before and put a fresh can of food in there. Cans of wet food are in a canvas thing on the kitchen counter next to the bread box.

Water
-----
- Water bowls are just inside the kitchen door. In the morning, I empty whatever water is left in the bowls as well as whatever has dripped into the bottom level and refill the bowls. I often top them up when I get home from work and/or right before I go to bed. Edgar drags this nested dish out into the room so watch out when you're walking in there. Cats have a tendency to get dehydrated so I pander to his idiosyncracies a bit. 

Cleanup
-------
- I keep the cat cleanup bags in the middle drawer in the bathroom. The cat shovel is in the closet near the door.
- Each morning, sift through the treasures in the litter box and put them in the cleanup bags. Tie off the top of the bag and take it to garbage shute by the elevators (if you don't take it outside within a few hours, you'll definitely regret it as the aroma permeates the place)
- The beautiful, dark floors in this place show the cat litter REALLY well. There are also flecks of light paint from when they re-painted the place. I typically sweep the hallway daily (broom is to the left of the fridge) but that's entirely up to you.


Leaving him for more than a day
--------------------------------
- If he'll be by himself for just a day or so, do the usual stuff on the day you're leaving and set out an extra water bowl in the kitchen. As long as the dry food container is reasonably full, he's going to starve and he can deal with the litter box not being cleaned for an extra day or so. Don't put out extra wet food - it'll dry out before Edgar eats it.
- Ideally, he should not be untended for more than 48 hours. 


Supplies
--------
- Toilet paper in the cabinet under the bathroom sink.
- Kitchen garbage bags and dishwasher detergent pods in the cabinet under the kitchen sink.
- Cleaning supplies (not that you're required to clean!) under the sink in the half bathroom. 
- There's a broom and dust pan in the gap between the left side of the fridge and the cabinets. Useful to address the cat litter and bits of dry food the creature drops on the floor without having to get out the vaccum.
- Vacuum cleaner is in the same closet as the litter box. It's 'bagless,' which means that the canister fills up with crap and you should empty it occasionally into the garbage. I usually empty it right before I vacuum.
- Eat and drink whatever you want that is edible and/or potable (not the cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink).


Environmental Control
---------------------
- Heat/AC controls are programmable and the controller is next to the window in the living room. You can set a temperature and then set it to auto, cool or heat.


TV/Cable/Alexa
--------------
- The RCN remote controls the TV input, cable and volumne. If you want to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime, hit the 'input' button in the top left of the RCN remote and select the 'HDMI4' option. Then use the little black Amazon remote. If you want to watch a DVD or Blu-Ray, select the 'HDMI3' input to use the Playstation. That remote is in the drawer of the little table next to the sofa.
- The Alexa in the living room goes by Alexa and I mostly use it to turn on the floor lamp by the window ("Alexa turn on/off the light")
 - The one in the bedroom goes by Echo.
 

Other notes
-----------
- Garbage: Garbage shute by the elevator. It's exciting to hear the rattling as people chuck garbage in there from the higher floors!
- Recycling: There's a recycling bin near the garbage shute by the elevator.
- Grocery store: Mariano's in the park you can see from the windows. The easiest way to get there is to cross Harbor Drive and go down a long set of stairs to get into the park.
- Convenience store: There's a Bockwinkel's you can get to without having to even go outside! If you go down to the lobby, there's a set of elevators just across from the doorman's station that lead to the parking garage. Go to the "C" level and turn right when you see the parking pay station. Turn right again and go through a long hallway. You'll get to a automatic door that leads into another building. Bockwinkel's is open until midnight every day.
- Fitness center and pool are on the lower level. You'll need the key fob to get in.
- If you order food, you will probably have to make sure the delivery person has your phone number. If you just give them the unit number, the doorman might call me instead of you to let them in.
- Lake front: If you go down those same stairs you'd use to go to the Mariano's and turn left and then left again to go under the street you just crossed. You'll go along the side of the building towards what looks like a parking lot under Lake Shore Drive. Just keep going straight and you'll come out on the path by the lake.
