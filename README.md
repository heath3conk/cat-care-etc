Cats
====

Food
----
- Dry food: In a dispenser with a timer. Just make sure there's food in the hopper.
- Wet food: Each morning, throw away any food left in the dish from the day before and put a fresh can of food in there. Nudgel doesn't eat the wet food so don't be alarmed if you don't see him near this dish.

Water
-----
- Water bowls on the windowsills in the front room: Empty yesterday's water into the plants in the front window and refill them. The shallower dish always has a pool of water around it because the cats are slobs. But since they drink from that dish more than from the other and cats, in general, have a tendency to become dehydrated, I just wipe up the water each morning and hope it hasn't quite rotted through the window sill.

Cleanup
-------
- In the left side of the cabinet under the bathroom sink, there's a box of cat litter with a sifter/shovel on top of it and a roll of cleanup bags (blue) next to it. 
- Each morning, sift through the treasures in the litter box and put them in the cleanup bags. Tie off the top of the bag and take it to the dumpster in the back alley (if you don't take it outside within a few hours, you'll definitely regret it as the aroma permeates the place)


Leaving them for more than a day
--------------------------------
- If they'll be by themselves for just a day or so, do the usual stuff on the day you're leaving and set out an extra water bowl on the counter by the sink. As long as the dry food container is reasonably full, they're not going to starve and they can deal with the litter box not being cleaned for an extra day or so. Don't put out extra wet food - it'll dry out before Edgar eats it.


Supplies
========
- Toilet paper in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. Additional rolls in the bedroom closet, all the way to the left side.
- Paper towels in the storage room downstairs.
- Kitchen garbage bags in the cabinet under the kitchen sink.
- Bathroom garbage bags (aka plastic bags from various stores) in the bottom drawer to the left of the refrigerator.
- Cleaning supplies (not that you're required to clean!) under the kitchen sink.
- Vacuum cleaner is in the guest room. It's 'bagless,' which means that the canister fills up with crap and you should empty it occasionally into the garbage.
- Eat and drink whatever you want that is edible and/or potable (not the cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink).


Other notes
===========
- Recycling: There's a recycling dumpster out in the alley. I don't have a bin in the condo, have been using brown paper bags which I keep on the right side of the refrigerator.
- Garbage: Dumpster out in the alley. Go out the back door to the deck - if you're coming back in, there's a brick just inside the gate to prop it open. Please don't prop it open for longer than it takes to go to the dumpster and make sure the gate closes when you come back!
